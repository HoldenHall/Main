# Main
This repository is made to showcase a few projects, the rest of my repositories we're made for school and a lot are forks.
Another good repository to visit is https://github.com/HoldenHall/ShockwaveTech. That repository was made for my software engineering team project and we collaborated to work on it. It's just a prototype and i'm assuming the database it used was shutdown so it's mostly used as reference now. Quicker Queue was a system designed to make queueing easier for businesses. I will include the SRS, and some other things not in that repository.
